# Welcome, friend 👋


## 🧑‍💻 I’m a Slavist from Germany and self taught developer.

🌱 Check out my spaced repetition web app for Russian vocabulary at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bajkal-app.de">bajkal-app.de</a>. I built it with Django, HTMX and Tailwind CSS and host it on DigitalOcean.

Right now it's a beta version, but you can still sign up and try out the test stack. If you want access to the test content, just send me a message.

💬 And this is my simple website powered by GitHub Pages and Jekyll: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bjoernkawecki.de">bjoernkawecki.de</a>.
